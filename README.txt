# Lightweight LLM Tool Router (Ollama + Python)

This project demonstrates a simple, safe way to let a local Ollama LLM choose and invoke tools (calculator, web search, weather, or direct response) using string-based tool calls without `eval` or LangChain agents.
It is designed for fast local models, easy debugging, and full control over tool execution logic.
